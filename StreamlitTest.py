## Introduction
Eskom wants to evaluate likelihood of success if they decide to invest in renewable energy.
We were provided with historical twitter feed data, together with climate change sentiment categories, based on tweets.
Eskom has also provided a sample of population tweets so that we can assist in determining climate change beliefs, based on the sample provided by Eskom.
